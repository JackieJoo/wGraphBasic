Collection of abstract data structures and algorithms to process graphs. The module does not bound to any specific format of a graph, so providing adapters toy may use it with anyone. It implements depth-first search, breadth-first search, extracting strongly connected components, topological sort, shortest path search, and others.

## Try out
```
npm install
node sample/Sample.s
```
