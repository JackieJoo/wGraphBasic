## Subgraph

Subgraph of a graph is another graph formed from subset of vertices and edges of the original graph.

## Induced subgraph

Induced subgraph of a graph is another graph formed from some subset of vertices of the original graph and  those edges of the original graph which have both endpoints in the induced subgraph.

## Clique

Clique is induced subgraph which is complete.

## Spanning subgraph

Spanning subgraph of a graph is another graph formed from all vertices of the original graph.

## Walk ~ Chain

Walk is a subgraph sequentially connected vertices of original graph. Also called chain. Walk can have more than one correspondence of a node of the original graph. Walk can have more than one correspondence of an edge of the original graph. In other word both vertices and edges of the original graph can be repeated in the walk.

## Open walk

Open walk is a walk which does not have cycle decomposition.

## Closed walk

Closed walk is a walk which has cycle decomposition.

## Trail

Trail is a walk each edge of original graph of which has one or none corresponding edge in the walk. In other word vertices of the original graph can be repeated in the trail, but not edges.

## Open trail

Open trail is a trail which does not have cycle decomposition.

## Closed trail ~ Circuit

Closed trail is a trail which has cycle decomposition. Closed trail is also called circuit.

## Path

Path is a walk each edge of original graph of which has one or none corresponding edge in the walk and each vertex of original graph of which has one or none corresponding vertex in the walk. In other word neither vertices nor edges of the original graph can be repeated in the path.

## Open path

Open path is a path which does not have cycle decomposition.

## Closed path ~ Cycle

Closed path is a path which has cycle decomposition. Closed path is also called circuit.

## Diameter

Diameter of a graph is the longest of the shortest path of the graph.

## Neighborhood

Neighborhood is an enduced subgraph of the graph, formed by all nodes adjacent to v.

## Graph decomposition

Graph decomposition - partitioning of edges of a graph.

## Cycle decomposition

Cycle decomposition - graph decomposition each element of which is cycle. Cycle decomposition possible only for even graph.
